# currency_calculatorv3
a JAVAFX tool. 

My first steps using JavaFX. 
With this calculator you can convert four currencies. EURO, DOLLAR, POUNDS and YEN. 
I donÂ´t know how to implement an API, yet. Therefore I hardcoded the exchange rates.

Things, I plan to change or add in the future:
- implement API for more and accurate exchange rates
- prevent typing in letters, where digits are expected
- maybe refurbishe the design
